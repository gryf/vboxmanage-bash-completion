VBoxManage bash completion script
=================================

This version of the completion was initially based on Sebastian T. Hafner
script. However, in some point of time I've decided to rewrite it almost from
scratch.

Current version of script was written and tested against VBoxManage in version
6.1.0, and should contain all commands and their options.

Unlike other attempts, I've tried to make the script context aware. See the
simple session with the VBoxManage command below, to have an idea how it works:

.. image:: /images/vboxmanage_session.gif?raw=true
   :alt: VBoxManage session


Note, that ``startvm`` command proposes only VMs, which are not running, while
``controlvm`` will complete only running VMs.

What is worth to mention, this completion script is a real thing, so it only
offer things which have sense for particular commands, for example:

.. image:: /images/vboxmanage_snapshot.gif?raw=true
   :alt: Take a snapshot

For ``snapshot take`` subcommand, the only options which are proposed are
``--live`` and ``--description``. Other commands and subcommands are behaving in
similar way.


Installation
============

Either source the file::

    $ . /path/to/this/repo/VBoxManage

or add it to a proper place depending on your distribution. Usual place would
be:

* ~/bash-completion.d/
* /usr/local/etc/bash-completion.d/
* /etc/bash_completion.d/
* etc.

It's also okay to copy it into some directory, and place proper line in
``.profile`` or ``.bashrc``::

    source /some/directory/VBoxManage
